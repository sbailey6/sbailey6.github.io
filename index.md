## Welcome!

### Research 

You can checkout my list of published [Research Papers](pages/reasearch.md). I am currently working towards my PhD at Binghamton University. My interests are in Machine Learning. 

### Machine Learning Experience

I have hands-on experience with: 
 
- Topic Analysis via **Latent Dirichlet Allocation** [LDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation), with a semi supervised version, [seededLDA](https://github.com/bsou/cl2_project/tree/master/SeededLDA) 
- Sentiment Analysis 
- Reddit Data Extraction via [pushshift.io](https://pushshift.io/)
- Sentence Structural Decomposition into Parts of Speech via [spaCy](https://spacy.io/)
- Pyscho-linguistic analysis via **linguistic inquiry and word count** [LIWC](https://liwc.wpengine.com/) discussed in this [Paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0261927X09351676)
- Models Heavily built upon **Hinge-Loss Markov Random Fields** (HLMRFs) and **Probabilistic Soft Logic**, [pioneered by these researchers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04406)

### Other Interests

- Reinforcement Learning
- Data Science / Data Visualizations
- Natural Language Processing 
- Supervised Learning  
- Mathematics and Physics

### Personal Coding 

I have various [Projects](pages/projects.md) which include personal and collaborative work. 

Some of my old [College Code](pages/college.md) proves personally useful from time to time.

### Eductional / Professional Background

For those that might be interested, my [Curriculum Vitae](pages/cv.md), [Work Experience](pages/experience.md), and [Resume](pages/resume.md)
